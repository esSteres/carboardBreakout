# carboardBreakout

A brick-breaker game built for google cardboard. Host the site somewhere, and you can visit it on your phone, slide it into a google cardboard headset, and play.

Push the button on the headset to send out the ball, and move your head to move the paddle. You get three lives. It's more a proof of concept than anything else, so don't expect some game design masterpiece here.
